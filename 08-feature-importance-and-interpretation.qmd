## Interpretation Is Not the Same as Prediction

A model can predict well and still be poorly understood.

Interpretation asks different questions:

- Which features does the model rely on?  
- How sensitive are predictions to each feature?  
- Are relationships stable or dataset-specific?  

Interpretation is useful, but it requires caution.

Feature importance is not causality.

---

## Global vs Local Explanations

Accuracy asks: how often are we right?

Interpretability asks: why are we right (or wrong)?

There are two common levels of explanation:

- **Global**: what inputs matter most overall in the model  
- **Local**: why a specific record received a specific prediction  

This lesson focuses on global feature influence using feature importance.

We include a lightweight local check to make interpretation feel concrete, without introducing heavy tooling.

If you cannot explain a model to a stakeholder, you do not fully understand your system.

## Load Data

```{python}
#| label: load-data
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data/ml-ready/cdi-customer-churn.csv")

X = df.drop(columns="churn")
y = df["churn"]
```

## Train/Test Split

```{python}
#| label: train-test-split
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X,
    y,
    test_size=0.2,
    random_state=42,
    stratify=y
)
```

## Define Preprocessing

```{python}
#| label: define-preprocessor
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder, StandardScaler
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline

numeric_features = X.select_dtypes(include=["int64", "float64"]).columns
categorical_features = X.select_dtypes(include=["object"]).columns

numeric_transformer = Pipeline(
    steps=[("scaler", StandardScaler())]
)

categorical_transformer = Pipeline(
    steps=[("encoder", OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore"))]
)

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ("num", numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ("cat", categorical_transformer, categorical_features)
    ]
)
```

## Train a Model

For feature importance, tree-based models are convenient because they provide built-in importances.

```{python}
#| label: train-tree
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier

tree = Pipeline(
    steps=[
        ("preprocessor", preprocessor),
        ("classifier", DecisionTreeClassifier(
            max_depth=4,
            min_samples_leaf=10,
            random_state=42
        ))
    ]
)

tree.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

---

## Built-in Feature Importance (Expanded Features)

Decision trees provide a feature importance score.

Because one-hot encoding expands categorical variables into multiple columns,
we build the expanded feature names first.

```{python}
#| label: get-expanded-feature-names
import numpy as np

ohe = (
    tree.named_steps["preprocessor"]
        .named_transformers_["cat"]
        .named_steps["encoder"]
)

cat_names = ohe.get_feature_names_out(categorical_features)
expanded_feature_names = np.concatenate([numeric_features, cat_names])

len(expanded_feature_names)
```

Extract importance values from the fitted tree.

```{python}
#| label: extract-built-in-importances
importances = tree.named_steps["classifier"].feature_importances_

imp_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "feature": expanded_feature_names,
    "importance": importances
}).sort_values("importance", ascending=False)

imp_df.head(10)
```

Plot top features.

```{python}
#| label: plot-built-in-importances
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

top = imp_df.head(10).iloc[::-1]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.barh(top["feature"], top["importance"])
ax.set_xlabel("Importance")
ax.set_title("Top Feature Importances (Decision Tree)")
plt.show()
```

---

## Permutation Importance (Original Features)

Permutation importance measures how much model performance drops when one input feature is randomly shuffled.

When computed on a pipeline, the permutation happens on the original input columns.

That means the results align with:

X.columns

not with expanded one-hot feature names.

```{python}
#| label: permutation-importance
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

result = permutation_importance(
    tree,
    X_test,
    y_test,
    n_repeats=10,
    random_state=42,
    scoring="f1"
)

perm_df = pd.DataFrame({
    "feature": X.columns,
    "importance_mean": result.importances_mean,
    "importance_std": result.importances_std
}).sort_values("importance_mean", ascending=False)

perm_df.head(10)
```

Plot permutation importances.

```{python}
#| label: plot-permutation-importances
top_p = perm_df.head(10).iloc[::-1]

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.barh(top_p["feature"], top_p["importance_mean"])
ax.set_xlabel("Mean importance (F1 drop)")
ax.set_title("Top Permutation Importances (Original Features)")
plt.show()
```

:::cdi-message
Permutation importance tells you what the model relies on, not what is causally true.

## A Lightweight Local Check

A true local explanation requires dedicated methods.

Here we do a lightweight check:

- take one record  
- compute its predicted probability  
- inspect the input values  

```{python}
#| label: local-prediction
row = X_test.iloc[[0]]
proba = tree.predict_proba(row)[0, 1]

proba
```

```{python}
#| label: inspect-record
row.T
```

This is not a full explanation, but it helps connect model output to a real input record.

---

## Interpreting Importances Responsibly

Important does not mean causal.

A feature can appear important because:

- it is correlated with the true driver  
- it encodes historical behavior  
- it captures an operational artifact  
- it is specific to this dataset  

Use feature importance as a diagnostic tool.

Not as a causal claim.
