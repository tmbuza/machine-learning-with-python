## Why This Guide Exists

Machine learning is often presented as a collection of algorithms.

Linear regression.  
Logistic regression.  
Decision trees.  
Neural networks.

But predictive modeling is not a menu of techniques.

It is a structured workflow:

Design → Data → Model → Evaluation → Interpretation

The focus of this guide is not complexity.  
The focus is discipline.

## What This Free Track Covers

This guide introduces the foundations of supervised machine learning:

- Framing regression and classification problems  
- Preparing data without leakage  
- Training baseline models in Python  
- Evaluating performance using appropriate metrics  
- Interpreting results cautiously  

This is the free foundational track.

Advanced modeling, tuning, ensembles, and deployment belong to the premium track.

## What This Guide Does Not Do

This guide does not:

- Promise state-of-the-art performance  
- Replace domain expertise  
- Teach every algorithm  
- Treat high accuracy as success without context  

Models produce predictions.  
Interpretation requires judgment.

## Prerequisites

You should be comfortable with:

- Basic Python syntax  
- Working with pandas DataFrames  
- Running commands in a terminal  

If not, complete the CDI Data Science Free Track first.

## Environment Setup

This project uses a virtual environment to isolate dependencies.

### Create the environment

```{bash}
#| label: create-environment
bash scripts/setup-env.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

This installs:

- pandas  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scikit-learn  

---

## Generate the Synthetic Dataset

```{bash}
#| label: generate-dataset
python scripts/make-cdi-customer-churn.py
```

The dataset will be saved to:

data/ml-ready/cdi-customer-churn.csv

This dataset will be used throughout the guide.

---

## Verify Installation

```{python}
#| label: verify-installation
import sklearn
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

sklearn.__version__
```

If a version number prints, the environment is working correctly.

---

## Rendering the Book

To render the Quarto book locally:

```{bash}
#| label: render-book
bash scripts/build-all.sh
```

The rendered output will appear in:

docs/

Navigation is handled automatically by Quarto.

## How to Approach This Guide

Do not rush.

Most machine learning errors occur in:

- Problem framing  
- Data leakage  
- Incorrect evaluation  
- Overinterpretation  

The next lesson begins with the most important skill:

Framing the prediction problem correctly.
